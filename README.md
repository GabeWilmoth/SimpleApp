The Spotify Alarm Clock (The name is not final) is an idea I came up with to solve a personal problem. Essentially, I’m working on an app that will link Spotify to an alarm clock and allow me to wake up to a shuffled playlist of songs every morning. In the future, I’d love to link several other platforms for streaming music to this app along with radio.   The Story Behind the Idea: I wake up to an alarm as do most people and I wake up to a set song, that I'd have to switch manually every night to get a different one. Therefore, after a while, I'd grow to hate that one song and associate it with waking up. Then the thought of “it would be nice to wake up to my Spotify playlist” came to me and I went to searching the internet and app store but only found unpopular paid apps and thought “I can do this better and for free”.
